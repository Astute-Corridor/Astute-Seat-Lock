# AC-GroupSeatLock
**Lock seats in an A-Chassis vehicle to a specified group. Licensed under MIT (open-source).**

This *should* work with every A-Chassis vehicle which inserts an "A-Chassis Interface."

All contributions are welcome!

## Installation

Insert the script under the `VehicleSeat` of the vehicle. May be called "DriveSeat" or other names. 
Do not insert this script into A-Chassis plugins; it will not work.
