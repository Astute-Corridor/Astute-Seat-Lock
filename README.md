# Astute Seat-Lock
**Lock seats in an A-Chassis vehicle to a specified group. Licensed under Apache-2.0 (open-source).**

**Features:**
* Customizeable
* Two types of detection methods which uses `SeatWelds` and the `.Occupant` property.
* Automatically deletes the `A-Chassis Interface` from the unauthorized user.
* Three methods of unauthorized handling: teleporting the user away from the vehicle, killing the user, and jumping the user away from the VehicleSeat.
* Double checks if the `A-Chassis Interface` *is* deleted.


This *should* work with every A-Chassis vehicle which inserts an `A-Chassis Interface`.

All contributions are welcome!
